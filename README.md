# TV Script Generator

Recurrent neural network to generate scripts for the TV show, The Simpsons. Note that the requirement was to generate scripts that looked similar to the input data - but did not have to be grammatically correct or sense at all - this was enough to demonstrate that the model was learning. Given more time and data the results could be improved.
